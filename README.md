# CADC_test_labels

In ```CADC_TEST_LABELS.7z``` we provide both human annotations and machine annotations. We note that human annotations are only available for 2 sequences (43 and 75 of date 2019-02-27). For the remaining 30 sequences we provide machine annotaions generated by 3D-OutDet. 

You need to install 7zip to unzip this ```CADC_TEST_LABELS.7z```

Use ```7z x CADC_TEST_LABELS.7z``` command to unzip the archive.

To make the workflow easy, we modified the CADC folder structure following the 
SemanticKITTI and WADS folder structure. SemKITTI and WADS have numerical sequence names. CADC has numerical sequences from three different dates, hence to make our life easy we combined the date and sequence number. 
Hence, ```'2019_02_27_0045'``` is the 45th Sequence taken from 2019_02_27 date. We had also shortened the path to the labels.
